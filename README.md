## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm MythicSorcerer, but you can call me mythic.

I'm currently working on [mythic.ddns.net](https://mythic.ddns.net), my website, which is sort of lacking in.... a lot of things
You can reach me via mythic_sorcerer on discord or email me at rustysparklymonkey@gmail.com

My pronouns are he/him
